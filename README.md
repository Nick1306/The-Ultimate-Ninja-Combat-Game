# The-Ultimate-Ninja-Combat-Game

This is a fun little game where player will be fighting against the computer, and the winner gets 
bragging rights.

I've developed this console game entirely using Python. This is a fun little game which will allow you to learn all the vital concepts of Python tech such as List, dictiornary etc. 

The player will start the game with a balance of $100. The player will choose a move, and so 
will the computer, and the winner of that round will be announced followed by the updated 
balance (depending on whether the player won or lost and how much he or she bet). The 
player should not be able to bet more than they have in their balance. 

The player will choose their move from a list of six possibilities, and the computer will 
randomly choose a move as well. Once the player has chosen their move the computer’s 
move will be revealed, and the winner declared. The possible moves are:

1. Punch of Fury
2. Kick of Punishment
3. Sword of Justice
4. Shuriken of Vengeance
5. Nunchucks of Anger
6. Knife of Freedom

Once the player chooses their move, console game will check the computers move and see 
who wins. 

At the end of the round the winner is declared and the updated current balance is displayed. 
The menu will then be presented again, allowing the player to get Information, Play or Quit. 
The player will be forced to quit if the player balance reaches $0. 
When the game quits, the game should display “Goodbye [player name]. Your final balance 
is $ [player’s final balance]. The game will then display the player’s balance history (their 
balance at the end of each round)

Enjoy!!
